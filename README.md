### Features I am looking to add:

- phrases
- different versions of words (i.e. mean vs meaning vs means)

### My thoughts

- The results vary greatly depending on what is considered "doing poorly". In this code I used 50% as a division, but it seems like many questions fell between 50% and the standard failing grade of 65% because when I tested my code using 65% as the division, the number of words in each column switched from being positively skewed to being negatively skewed.

## Running the code

- fork and clone the repo
- run 'npm install' in the directory
- run 'npm start' and open 'localhost:3000'
